About Longest Prefix Match

* Overview

  Longest Prefix Match is an implementation of an associative array which
  doesn't associate keys to values using either the <<<equals()>>> or the
  <<<hashCode()>>>. Instead it compares the beginning of a String with the
  containing keys. The longest possible match will be associated and the value
  be returned.

* Usage

  Longest Prefix Match is implemented using Scala. Nevertheless it provides
  classes which allow an easy integration with Java, too.
  The following sections describe how Longest Prefix Match can be used using
  either Scala or Java.

** Scala

  Lets pretend you want to retrieve a Int value according to a number
  range. The two Int values being 1 and 2. 1 for "123" - "456" range and 2 for
  "8" range. You'd add them as follows:

+--
val lpm = new LongestPrefixMatch[Int].
  addValueForRange("123", "456", 1).
  addValueForRange("8", "8", 2)
+--

  To retrieve the values you could do as follows:

+--
lpm.getValueFromPrefix("2") match {
  case Some(i) => println(i)
  case _ => println("Nothing found")
}
/* This would print 1 in conjunction with the previous statements */
+--

  Or shorter:

+--
val lpm = new LongestPrefixMatch << ("123", "456", 1) << ("8", "8", 2)
lpm("2") match {
  case Some(i) => println(i)
  case _ => println("Nothing found")
}
+--

** Java

  The Java equivalent of the above example would look as follows:

+--
LongestPrefixMatchJ<Integer> lpm = new LongestPrefixMatchJ<Integer>();
lpm = lpm.addValueForRange("123", "456", 1);
lpm = lpm.addValueForRange("8", "8", 2);
+--

  And again to retrieve the values it would look as follows:

+--
Integer i = lpm.getValueFromPrefix("2");
if(null == i)
	System.out.println("Nothing found");
else
	System.out.prinln(i);
+--
