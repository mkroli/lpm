About Longest Prefix Match

* Overview

  Longest Prefix Match is an implementation of an associative array which
  doesn't associate keys to values using either the <<<equals()>>> or the
  <<<hashCode()>>>. Instead it compares the beginning of a String with the
  containing keys. The longest possible match will be associated and the value
  be returned.
